<div class="page-header"><h2>Current Job - Real Hourly Wage</h2></div>
<p>It's true that some jobs pay more than others per year. But time is money and what you've been told is your hourly wage may not necessarily accurate. By tallying up the total hours you spend on work-related activities and the total amount of money you spend on work-related expenses, you can find your real hourly wage for your current job and decide whether you're being paid what you think you're worth. Perhaps a job with a lower annual salary will actually provide you a higher real hourly wage! Below, add all of your work-related incomes and expenditures along with their corresponding hours spent in an average week. For example, if your daily round-trip commute is 2 hours, 5 days a week, add an entry for 10 hours and an expenditure corresponding to the cost of gas for the commute.</p>
