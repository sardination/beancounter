                    Inspired by methods to achieve financial independence, Bean Counter is a tool for anyone - whether you're aspiring to become financially independent or just to get a better grasp of your cash - to transform their relationship with money. By becoming more acutely aware of where your money is coming from and where it's going every day, you'll be able to answer questions like those posed above. When you take control of your finances, you will no longer be controlled by your money or lack thereof.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You'll be guided through <strong>three timelines</strong> that will help you gradually make financial control a part of your daily life:

Over time, you'll see your investment income approach your expenses and become enough to cover your monthly living costs without your day job, meaning you've achieved financial independence. You can also find out how much you need to have saved in assets in order to retire!</p>
